# Programming-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
# The purpose of this programming assignment is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

#Data inclueds
# 'README.txt'
# 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
# 'features.txt': List of all features.
# 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
# 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
# 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
# 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
# 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


# R script called run_analysis.R does the following. 
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
